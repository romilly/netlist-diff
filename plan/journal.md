# Project journal for netlist-diff

## Friday 22 July 2022

I'm  developing this via TDD, and intending to publish this vi PyPi, so my
[walking skeleton](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/walking-skeleton)
will have two components.

1. I've
   1. set up the `setup.cfg` and `project.toml` files needed to **build a wheel ready for distribution**,
   2. set up my standard project structure complete with its own virtual environment,
   3. added the build and wheel packages, along with PyHamcrest which I will use for my tests,
   4. created a trivial diff.py that prints 'Hello world',
   5. and built a wheel
2. Next I'll **create a program using TDD** that implements a very thin slice of application functionality.
